 # Roller Derby Website

This is a website for a local roller derby team to help promote and create public awareness by including information on the team, upcoming events, learn the basics of the sport, 
as well the ability to sign up for information regarding joining the team.
 
## UX
 

The aim of this website is to primarily to attract two types of user. The first being someone who doesn't know anything about roller derby, is interested in finding out more and is perhaps interested in joining the team. This user can view videos that give a high level overview of the sport. They can also fill in a contact form should they 
be interested in joining. 

The second type of user is someone who is just interested in following the team and is checking out if there are any events coming up, or simply want the latest news on the team. This information is present on the home page.  

Userâ€™s goals: To get information about the team; fundraising events, upcoming games, squad, news, basic information about the rules of roller derby from the official governing body.


A folder containing mockups is available in the Github page for this project.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
    
2. Internal and external links. 
	1. Checked to ensure that the links in the navbar directed to the correct pages ensuring that the site could be navigated. 
	2. Clicked on links that directed the user to another site. Ensuring that they pointed to the correct site and also opened in a new browser window. 
    

- Bugs
